# Lumination AI for Moodle

Generate full Moodle courses from your documents using AI.

## Features

**AI Course Generator** - Upload PDFs, Word documents, or text files and automatically generate a structured Moodle course with sections and lesson content.

### How it works

1. **Upload** - Upload your source documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, PPTX)
2. **Review** - AI generates a course outline that you can edit (add/remove modules and lessons)
3. **Create** - One click creates a full Moodle course with sections and page activities

## Subscription Required

**This plugin requires a Lumination AI API key.**

The plugin connects to the Lumination AI API to extract text from documents and generate course content using AI. An API key is required for the plugin to function.

**Pricing:** $0.0495 per lesson generated. First $50 in credits included for free.
